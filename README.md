# Pipebot

Robotic platform for inspecting pipelines with a diameter of 14 inches or larger, capable of visualizing anomaly situations using cameras and other sensors. The proposed device composition consists mainly of low-cost materials, such as 3D-printed polymer parts. The platform features locomotion mechanisms via tracks, which can be adjusted to overcome specific conditions of each pipeline. The robot's software utilizes the ROS (Robot Operating System), facilitating the implementation of autonomous functionalities and the possibility of anomaly identification. This article introduces the robotic platform, the preliminary results of the mechanical and electronic design, and the software embedded in the robot, demonstrating the feasibility of producing low-cost alternatives for inspecting industrial pipes of reduced diameters.
